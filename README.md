Ethereum RPC Client Library in .Net C#, Web3.js in .net.

**Work in progress**, consider this as a working spike for different rpc commands, including calling contracts. Have a look at the different test projects for usage. 

To startup a development chain you can use https://github.com/juanfranblanco/Ethereum.TestNet.Genesis. Note that some of the command line tests uses the account in this chain.

Sugestions, ideas, please raise an issue. Want to collaborate, create a pull request.

##Example of deploying a contract and calling a function

This is an example of all the stages required to deploy and call a contract using the JSON RPC API, it is aimed to also give an understanding of how Ethereum works. Function calls using eth_call will not be mined, and won't use any gas. To mine a "function call" you will need to use a transaction, calling a transaction won't return any values.

Note: Using solc to compile contracts is currently a hit and miss in Windows, the simplest way to compile and develop at the moment is to [use the online solidity compiler](https://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/). If you like Visual Studio Code you can try this [languange add on for Solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/JuanBlanco.solidity)

ABI encoding and decoding has been tested on windows/linux for different endiannes. For more info on ABI encoding check the [Ethereum Wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI)

### Events, logs and filters

This is a demonstration how you can raise events from your solidity contract and filter and capture them from the logs.
On the example you can see how a contract is deployed, then using the contract address we subscribe to all the events raised by the contract using filters. Transactions are submitted and the logs are retrived by polling using the filter. From the logs we can retrive the event encoded signature and event data (indexed in the logs and in the data).

```csharp
    /* This is the example contract containing an event raised every time we call multiply
            contract test { 
    
                event Multiplied(uint indexed a, address sender);
    
                function multiply(uint a) returns(uint d) 
                { 
                    Multiplied(a, msg.sender);
                    return a * 7; 
                    
                } 
    
            }*/

### Running on Linux
* Install DNX following the [asp.net guide](http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/getting-started/installing-on-linux.html). (Use coreclr)
* Run dnu restore at the solution level, to restore all packages and dependencies.
    ```dnu restore ```
* Compile using only dnxcore 
    ```dnu build --framework dnxcore50 ```
* Run using dnx (ie dnx text, dnx run)

### Current TODO
This is the current TODO list in order of priority 
* ~~Generic RPC~~
* ~~ABI encoding, contract deployment, contract transaction and calls example, together with an end to end example on how Ethereum works~~.
* ~~Windows / Linux deployment and unit test~~
* ~~Filters, Events and Logging, together with and end to end example for reference on how Ethereum works.~~
* Refactor 
* BigIntegers everywhere as opposed to long / int64
* ABI is currently implemented following the structure of ethereumj, so both can be used as a point of reference. Encoding and Decoding is slightly different due .Net little Endian. Instead of using objects, generics could be use for the return types to avoid boxing and unboxing, this will diverge both implementations.
* Complete other RPC methods.
* Introduction of different services for Account, Blockchain, Contract creation, Transaction / Call submission (ie Transfer, Contract call)
* Nuget
* Code generate Contract / Function to simplify usage 
* Example of unit testing contracts (.net driven)
* Example of using [dapple / dappsys](https://github.com/NexusDevelopment/dapple) unit testing (solidity driven).
* Example of windows universal app using a contract (Windows, Mobile, RPI2)
