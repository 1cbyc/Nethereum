Ethereum RPC Client Library in .Net C#, Web3.js in .net.

Work in progress, consider this as a working spike for different rpc commands, including calling contracts. Have a look at the different test projects for usage. 

To startup a development chain you can use https://github.com/juanfranblanco/Ethereum.TestNet.Genesis. Note that some of the command line tests uses the account in this chain.

##Example of deploying a contract and calling a function

This is an example of all the stages required to deploy and call a contract using the JSON RPC API, it is aimed to also give an understanding of how Ethereum works. Function calls using eth_call will not be mined, and won't use any gas. To mine a "function call" you will need to use a transaction, calling a transaction won't return any values.

Note: Using solc to compile contracts is currently a hit and miss in Windows, the simplest way to compile and develop at the moment is to [use the online solidity compiler](https://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/). If you like Visual Studio Code you can try this [languange add on for Solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/JuanBlanco.solidity)

ABI encoding and decoding is currently tested on windows with BigEndian support. For more info on ABI encoding check the [Ethereum Wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI)

            //contract test { function multiply(uint a) returns(uint d) { return a * 7; } }
            var contractByteCode = "0x606060405260728060106000396000f360606040526000357c010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000090048063c6888fa1146037576035565b005b604b60048080359060200190919050506061565b6040518082815260200191505060405180910390f35b6000600782029050606d565b91905056";

            var ethSendTransation = new EthSendTransaction();
            //As the input the compiled contract is the Data, together with our address
            var transactionInput = new EthSendTransactionInput();

            // retrieve the hash
            var transactionHash =  await ethSendTransation.SendRequestAsync(client, transactionInput);

            //get contract address 
            var ethGetTransactionReceipt = new EthGetTransactionReceipt();
            EthTransactionReceipt receipt = null;

### Current TODO
This is the current TODO list in order of priority 
* Test in Linux Endianism
* Filters, Events and Logging, together with and end to end example for reference on how Ethereum works.
* Complete other RPC methods.
* Refactor 
* ABI is currently implemented following the structure of ethereumj, so both can be used as a point of reference. Encoding and Decoding is slightly different due .Net little Endian. Instead of using objects, generics could be use for the return types to avoid boxing and unboxing, this will diverge both implementations.
* Introduction of different services for Account, Blockchain, Contract creation, Transaction / Call submission (ie Transfer, Contract call)
* Code generate Contract / Function to simplify usage 
* Example of unit testing contracts (.net driven)
* Example of using [dapple / dappsys](https://github.com/NexusDevelopment/dapple) tests for solidity driven.
